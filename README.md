## Use of external library:

We have used Bootstrap's Grid system (container class), and Google MDC guidelines for our UI components.

## Git Flow method:

- Our Git flow started with the Git Team Leader assigning issues for each team members' responsible page.
- The main source initially consisted of a README with basic guidelines, component.html, a style.css for the components for the members to use, as well as a Javascrpit file for functionalities.
- Each members then cloned the source code.
- Then each members branched their own feature branch for their respective issues, and coding their own pages.
- Members can copy styles and html codes for the respective components that they would use and add more rules to syle to their liking in another separate css file but within the guidelines in our convention guide.
- Once finished, members pulled request to the TL and as we all are new to Github, and to avoid too many merge conflicts, we decided to merge each branch together one by one in the order that the members finished locally.
- Final merge was done on the local repository of issue28 and pushed to the develop branch.
- Each members finished their own issues and feature branches.
- TL branched the release/1.0 branch and cleaned up the branches on the remote repository.
- Finally, we merged release/1.0 to develop and main branches with the tag 1.0 in the remote repository
